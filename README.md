### **Hi, I'm Alex** ðŸ‘‹ 

Here's how to contact me: ðŸ’¬ +393516140060   ðŸ“« aj0312@my.bristol.ac.uk   :computer: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-90-jennings/)

Since Feb 2022 I have been learning and exploring the possibilities in the world of code! 6 months ago I assumed that there was one correct way to code, now I understand that creativity and problem solving is just as important as knowledge of functions/methods. Over the next 6 months I plan to improve my problem solving with daily code war exercises, expand my knowledge in some new languages (Python, Pine Script, Typescript) and create some awesome applications/websites!

#LANGUAGE STATS

#**Some repos that I am proud of:**

A player vs computer blackjack game [BLACKJACK](https://github.com/Alex90Jennings/react-blackjack)
   - A player can play a hand vs the dealer, and bet on the result
   - My first full stack application built from scratch
   - Implementing a finite state machine would make the game process and expansion easier to manage

A spotify clone with an opera theme [OPERAFY](https://github.com/Alex90Jennings/boolean-uk-html-spotify)
   - HMTL and CSS clone of spotify
   - Prastising CSS grids
   - Soon I will add JS to add functionality to the clone


#**Here is what I am working on now:** 

A team development simulation, working together with 10 other students to implement features for a teacher's portal, so that teachers can track and create notes on students [CLIENT /](https://github.com/Alex90Jennings/team-dev-client-c5) [SERVER](https://github.com/Alex90Jennings/team-dev-server-c5)

**What's up next?:** 

Using a finite state machine (XState) I plan to code a variation of a game card that I invented with some friends on a long train ride in India

**And after?:** 

Learn Pinescript to develop some custom indicators to assist decision making while trading the financial markets, based on Fibonacci and volume spread analysis
