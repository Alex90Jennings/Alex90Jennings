### **Hi, I'm Alex** ðŸ‘‹ 

Since Feb 2022 I have been learning and exploring the possibilities in the world of code! 6 months ago I assumed that there was one correct way to code, now I understand that creativity and problem solving is just as important as knowledge of functions/methods.

**Some repos that I am proud of:**
A player vs computer blackjack game https://github.com/Alex90Jennings/react-blackjack
A spotify clone with an opera theme https://github.com/Alex90Jennings/boolean-uk-html-spotify

**Here is what I am working on now:** a team development simulation, working together with 10 other students to implement features for a teacher's portal, so that teachers can track and create notes on students CLIENT: https://github.com/Alex90Jennings/team-dev-client-c5 SERVER: https://github.com/Alex90Jennings/team-dev-server-c5
**What's up next?:** using a finite state machine (XState) I plan to code a variation of a game card that I invented with some friends on a long train ride in India
**And after?:** learn Pinescript to develop some custom indicators to assist decision making while trading the financial markets, based on Fibonacci and volume spread analysis

**My current stack:**
HTML, CSS, JS, REACT, Node.js
