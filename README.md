Since Feb 2022 I have been learning and exploring the possibilities in the world of code! 6 months ago I assumed that there was one correct way to code, now I understand that creativity and problem solving is just as important as knowledge of functions/methods. Over the next 6 months I plan to improve my problem solving with daily code war exercises, expand my knowledge in some new languages (Python, Pine Script, Typescript) and create some awesome applications/websites!

## <h2 align="center">FUTURE PROJECTS: </h2> 

### Here is what I am working on now:

A team development simulation, working together with 10 other students to implement features for a teacher's portal, so that teachers can track and create notes on students [CLIENT](https://github.com/Alex90Jennings/team-dev-client-c5) / [SERVER](https://github.com/Alex90Jennings/team-dev-server-c5)

### What's up next?:

Using a finite state machine (XState) I plan to code a variation of a game card that I invented with some friends on a long train ride in India

### And after?:

Learn Pinescript to develop some custom indicators to assist decision making while trading the financial markets, based on Fibonacci and volume spread analysis
